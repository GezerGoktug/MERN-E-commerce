### 🔨 **Technologies Used:**

### 💻 **Frontend:**

### **Monorepo Architecture**
It is an approach that keeps multiple projects under a single repository (root directory), but also allows these projects to be managed independently. 
<br>
Advantages:
- Each application is developed independently,
- Code base complexity is avoided,
- Teams can work on their own applications without interfering with others.

The codebase started to grow for Admin and main application . For this reason this two application divided two app,two repo and two codebase within monorepo as admin and main.Pnpm was used for monorepo arch. Some frequently used structure transfered to libs folders. These folders can install and call inside apps same a npm package.The codebase started to grow for Admin and main application .
