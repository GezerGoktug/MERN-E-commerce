### 🔨 **Technologies Used:**

### 💻 **Frontend:**

### **Monorepo Architecture**
It is an approach that keeps multiple projects under a single repository (root directory), but also allows these projects to be managed independently. 
<br>
Advantages:
- Each application is developed independently,
- Code base complexity is avoided,
- Teams can work on their own applications without interfering with others.

The codebase started to grow for Admin and main application . For this reason this two application divided two app,two repo and two codebase within monorepo as admin and main.Pnpm was used for monorepo arch. Some frequently used structure transfered to libs folders. These folders can install and call inside apps same a npm package.

### 🌐 **AI Customer Support Chatbot with Langchain and Langgraph**

A chatbot was created using Langchain and Langgraph to provide customer support. Two tools were defined in the system that the LLM  can use with Langchain and Langgraph: one for general questions and one for product recommendations.

Some conditional explanatory instructions were generated to determine which tool the LLM should use based on the customer's intent. The LLM analyzes the user's intent, sends the appropriate parameters to the appropriate tool, and waits for a response. Vector search was used for both general questions and product recommendations. 

For general information, the vector tools in Langchain break down the text in the PDF document containing the information content into parts, and then these data are converted into vectors. To avoid further conversion, this data is stored in a local vector database called faiss-node. Based on cosine similarities, the closest text fragments are found and sent to the LLM, which then generates a suitable response for the user. 

For product recommendations, vector versions of the semantic parts of the products are stored in a MongoDB database. Vector search support in MongoDB is used to perform vector searches and retrieve the most similar products. Sometimes the data requested by the user is not semantic, for example, the top 3 most priced products. Since this is more of a numerical ranking, it doesn't contain any semantic information, but in such cases, LLM instructions are provided to send filter values. Thus, support is provided for scenarios where the data is not semantic. 

The RAG architecture is used as the basis for this type of vector search scenario. Langgraph also assists LLM in running additional functions and conditional routing tools with the instructions given to LLM.
